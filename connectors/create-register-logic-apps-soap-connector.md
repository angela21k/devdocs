# Create and register SOAP custom connectors in Azure Logic Apps (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

To integrate SOAP services in your Azure Logic Apps workflows, you can create and register a custom Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) connector by using Web Services Description Language (WSDL) that describes your SOAP service. The SOAP connectors work like prebuilt connectors, so you can use them in the same way as other connectors in your logic apps. Currently, SOAP custom connectors don't support one-way operations.

> - This is a preview feature.

## Prerequisites

To register your SOAP connector, you need:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can start with a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). As an alternative, you can sign up for a [pay-as-you-go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/).

* Either of the following:

  * A URL to a WSDL file that defines your SOAP service and the APIs.
  * A WSDL file that defines your SOAP service and the APIs.

  For this procedure, you can use our example, [Orders SOAP Service](http://fazioapisoap.azurewebsites.net/FazioService.svc?singleWsdl).

* (Optional) An image to use as an icon for your custom connector.

## 1. Create your connector

1. In the Azure portal on the main Azure menu, select **New**.

1. In the search box, enter **logic apps connector**, and then select **Enter**.

   ![Screenshot of searching for "logic apps connector".](./media/create-register-logic-apps-soap-connector/create-logic-apps-connector.png "Search for logic apps connector")

1. From the **Results** list, select **Logic Apps Connector** > **Create**.

   ![Screenshot of Create Logic Apps connector.](./media/create-register-logic-apps-soap-connector/choose-logic-apps-connector.png "Create Logic Apps connector")

1. Enter details for registering your connector as described in the table. When you're done, select the **Pin to dashboard** checkbox, and then select **Create**.

   ![Screenshot of Logic Apps custom connector details.](./media/create-register-logic-apps-soap-connector/logic-apps-soap-connector-details.png "Logic Apps custom connector details")

   | Property | Suggested value | Description | 
   | -------- | --------------- | ----------- | 
   | Name | soap-connector-name | Enter a name for your connector. | 
   | Subscription | Azure-subscription-name | Select your Azure subscription. | 
   | Resource group | Azure-resource-group-name | Create or select an Azure group for organizing your Azure resources. | 
   | Location | deployment-region | Select the same Azure region as your logic app. | 
  
After Azure deploys your connector, the Logic Apps connector menu should open. If it doesn't, select your SOAP connector from the Azure dashboard.

## 2. Define your connector

Specify the WSDL file or URL for creating your connector, the authentication that your connector uses, and the actions and triggers that your SOAP connector provides.

### 2a. Specify the WSDL file or URL for your connector

1. On your connector's menu, select **Logic Apps Connector** if it isn't already selected.

1. On the toolbar, select **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of Edit custom connector](./media/create-register-logic-apps-soap-connector/edit-soap-connector.png "Edit custom connector")

1. Select **General** to provide the details in these tables for creating, securing, and defining the actions and triggers for your SOAP connector.

    1. For **Custom connectors**, select **SOAP** for your **API Endpoint** to provide the WSDL file that describes your API.

       ![Screenshot of providing the WSDL file for your API](./media/create-register-logic-apps-soap-connector/provide-wsdl-file.png "SOAP API Endpoint")


       | Option                 | Format               | Description           |
       |-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
       | Upload WSDL from file |  WSDL-file        | Browse to the location for your WSDL file, and select that file. |
       | Upload WSDL from URL  | http://path-to-wsdl-file |  Enter the URL for your service's WSDL file.    |
       | SOAP to REST    |     Not applicable              |  Transform APIs in the SOAP service into REST APIs.          | 


    1. For **General information**, upload an icon for your connector.

       Typically, the **Description**, **Host**, and **Base URL** fields are automatically populated from your WSDL file. If they aren't, add this information as described in the table, and then select **Continue**. 

       ![Screenshot of Connector details](./media/create-register-logic-apps-soap-connector/add-general-details.png "Connector details")

       | Option or setting | Format | Description | 
       | ----------------- | ------ | ----------- | 
       | Upload Icon | png-or-jpg-file-under-1-MB | An icon that represents your connector <p>Color: Preferably a white logo against a color background. <p>Dimensions: A logo approximately 160 &times; 160 pixels inside a square 230 &times; 230 pixels | 
       | Icon background color | icon-brand-color-hexadecimal-code | The color behind your icon that matches the background color in your icon file. <p>Format: Hexadecimal. For example, #007ee5 represents the color blue. | 
       | Description | connector-description | Enter a short description for your connector. | 
       | Host | connector-host | Enter the host domain for your SOAP service. | 
       | Base URL | connector-base-URL | Enter the base URL for your SOAP service. | 

### 2b. Describe the authentication that your connector uses

1. Select **Security**, and then review or describe the authentication that your connector uses. Authentication makes sure that your users' identities flow appropriately between your service and any clients.

   By default, your connector's **Authentication type** is set to **No authentication**.

   ![Screenshot of authentication type.](./media/create-register-logic-apps-soap-connector/security-authentication-options.png "Authentication type")

   To change the authentication type, select **Edit**. You can select **Basic authentication**. To use parameter labels other than default values, update them under **Parameter label**.

   ![Screenshot of basic authentication.](./media/create-register-logic-apps-soap-connector/security.png "Basic authentication")

1. To save your connector after entering the security information, at the top of the page, select **Update connector**, and then select **Continue**. 

### 2c. Review, update, or define actions and triggers for your connector

1. Select **Definition**, and then review, edit, or define new actions and triggers that users can add to their workflows.

   Actions and triggers are based on the operations defined in your WSDL file, which automatically populate the **Definition** page, and include the request and response values. If the required operations already appear here, you can go to the next step in the registration process without making changes on this page.

   ![Screenshot of the connector definition.](./media/create-register-logic-apps-soap-connector/definition.png "Connector definition")

1. (Optional) If you want to edit existing actions and triggers, or add new ones, go to [an example of editing an API definition](define-postman-collection.md#update-the-definition).

## 3. Finish creating your connector

When you're ready, select **Update Connector** to deploy your connector. 

Congratulations! Now when you create a logic app, you can find your connector in Logic Apps Designer and add that connector to your logic app.

## Share your connector with other Logic Apps users

Registered but uncertified custom connectors work like Microsoft-managed connectors, with one exception. They're available *only* to the connector's author and users who have the same Azure Active Directory tenant and Azure subscription for Logic Apps in the region where those apps are deployed. Although sharing is optional, you might have scenarios where you want to share your connectors with other users. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you share a connector, others might start to depend on that connector. Deleting your connector deletes all connections to that connector.

To share your connector with external users outside these boundaries—for example, with all Logic Apps users—certify your connector. To learn more, go to [Certify your connector](submit-certification.md).
