# Managed connectors outbound IP addresses
Suppose you have an environment with strict network requirements or firewalls that limit traffic to specific IP addresses. If you use [managed connectors](/connectors/connectors) or [custom connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors/) in Azure Logic Apps or Microsoft Power Platform, your environment or firewall must allow access for the outbound IP addresses used by these connectors in your datacenter region. Otherwise, requests sent by these connectors won't work.

When configuring firewall access rules please pay attention to the port numbers. Most connectors work on top of HTTPS protocol and use default HTTPS port: 443. However, some connectors may use other protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.) and port numbers. It's recommended to configure firewall inbound rules as following:
* For *destination* (*local*) port - allow the appropriate port for the network protocol.
* For *source* (*remote*) port - allow *ANY*/*ALL*.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Logic Apps and Microsoft Power Platform services have their own datacenter regions.


## Azure Logic Apps
This section lists the outbound IP addresses and service tags required by the managed connectors in the Azure Logic Apps service. Before you start, review these considerations:
* The Azure Logic Apps service also has inbound and output IP addresses that require access. For more information, review [Azure Logic Apps - Firewall IP configuration considerations](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-ip-configuration).
* For [Azure China 21Vianet](/azure/china/), fixed or reserved IP addresses are unavailable for managed connectors and custom connectors in China North and China East regions. However, they are available in China North 2 and China East 2 regions.
* If your workflows run in the [single-tenant Azure Logic Apps environment](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview), you need the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) for your connections. For more information, review the corresponding sections in these topics:
  * [Azure portal - Find domain names for firewall access in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-azure-portal#firewall-setup)
  * [Visual Studio Code - Find domain names for firewall access in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/create-single-tenant-workflows-visual-studio-code#firewall-setup)
* If you create and use security rules, you can reduce complexity by using [service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview) instead. That way, you don't have to explicitly specify the IP address prefixes for each region. Service tags work across the regions where the Azure Logic Apps service is available. 
* For more information about serice tags, see [Virtual network service tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview).

  The `AzureConnectors` tag represents the IP address prefixes used by managed connectors to make *outbound* calls to their respective services. The same service tag also represents IP address prefixes used by some managed connectors to make *inbound webhook callbacks* to the Azure Logic Apps service. Each region also has their own `AzureConnectors.[region]` service tag. You can use the same service tag to include all the IP address prefixes used by managed connectors.

  For example, the following managed connectors make inbound webhook callbacks to the Azure Logic Apps service: Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Sign, Adobe Sign Demo, Adobe Sign Preview, Adobe Sign Stage, Azure Sentinel, Business Central, Calendly, Common Data Service, DocuSign, DocuSign Demo, Dynamics 365 for Fin & Ops, LiveChat, Office 365 Outlook, Outlook.com, Parserr, SAP*, Shifts for Microsoft Teams, Teamwork Projects, and Typeform.
