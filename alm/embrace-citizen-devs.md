# Scenario 6: Embrace your citizen developers in the ALM process
Use the [Center of Excellence (CoE) kit](../guidance/coe/starter-kit.md) that provides customizable apps, flows, and dashboards to showcase the admin and governance capabilities in Microsoft Power Platform. Use the kit to adapt application lifecycle management (ALM) at scale in your organization.
